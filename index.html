            My name is Katharine Yuan. I was born and raised Provo, Utah. I am a family history research major at Brigham Young University-Idaho. 
            I enjoy knitting, logic puzzles, reading, history, and playing my violin. I studied German in high school and college. 
            I specialize in genealogical research in Northwest Germany. I lived in Washington state for three years while my ex-husband was in the army. 
            Mt. St. Helens was one of my favorite places to visit while I lived in Washington. Mt. Ranier is pretty cool too. I've recently picked up computer and web development as a hobby. 
            An interesting quote about genealogy that I like: "Stories have to be told or they die, and when they die, we can't remember who we are or why we're here." - Sue Monk Kidd</p>

        <p>Utah is located in the Mountain West or "Jello belt." It is the home of many national parks and national monuments. One of the most prominent features-and also an image on the state license plate-is Delicate Arch, which is located in Arches National Park.</p>
